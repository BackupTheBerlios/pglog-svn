Just run the setup script.

The script assumes that psql is in your PATH.

If you want to enable change log support for all (newly created)
databases, select the template1 database.

Since the PL/Python language is untrusted, you must login to the
database as superuser.


The syntax is

setup.py install -U postgres -d template1

assuming that the superuser name is postgres and that you want to
install pglog to template1 database.

To uninstall pglog run
setup.py unistall

with the same options.
