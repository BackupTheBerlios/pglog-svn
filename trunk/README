INTRODUCTION: 
pglog is a set of database functions written in the PL/Python language
that enable to log changes on selected tables.

All functions, and the log table, are in the pglog schema.

To enable log for a table do:
SELECT pglog.enable_log('table')

Table MUST have a primary key.

At every INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE, the changes to the table are logged
in the pglog.Logs table; moreover a NOTIFY named pglog is sent.

The pglog.Logs table can be DELETE only by members of the group logger
(created by the installer).

The logging can be disabled using pglog.disable_log.

pglog allow users to revert changes.
The function is pglog.reverd(id), where id is the id of the change.

Please, note that the revert function is very simple and can fail for
several reasons.
It tries only to revert the specified change, ignoring the effects of
subsequent changes.

Here is a simple example:

CREATE TABLE test (
       x INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
       s TEXT
);

INSERT INTO test VALUES (1, 'a');
DELETE test WHERE x = 1
INSERT INTO test VALUES (1, 'b');

now, reverting the DELETE command causes an error.
